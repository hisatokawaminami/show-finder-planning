## Project Proposal
Name of Student: Hisato Kawaminami

Name of Project: Live Music Show Finder
Project’s Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?):
- To gather a list of shows from local music venues for a selected date

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
- A user can select a date and then a show from a venue be displayed

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to yourtrack, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
- JavaScript
- React
- APIs

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

- Scrape data from multiple venues and add the info to the show list
If there is no show listed on the venue’s websites, make those dates can be searchable for bands to find out what dates the venues have open for booking a potential show


Is there anything else you’d like your instructor to know?
I haven’t had a chance to look into how I can make this happen yet, but I will find some time and do a research
